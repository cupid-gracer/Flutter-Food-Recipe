# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/loader.gif
    - assets/images/loader1.gif
    - assets/images/transparentBG.png
    - assets/images/checkmark.png
    - assets/images/close.png
    - assets/images/fbLogo.png
    - assets/images/google_logo.png
    - assets/images/app_icon.png
    - assets/images/noProfilePic.png
    - assets/images/skip.png
    - assets/images/loginBg.png
    - assets/images/no_recipe.png
    - assets/images/splash_bg.png
    - assets/images/youtube.png
    - assets/images/subscription.jpg
    - assets/images/fg_en.png
    - assets/images/fg_sp.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  fonts:
    - family: CustomIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/CustomIcons.ttf

    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
